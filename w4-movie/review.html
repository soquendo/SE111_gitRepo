                    <h3><b>Sebastian Oquendo</b>&nbsp;<i>February 8, 2022</i></h3>
                    <p>Featuring an ensemble cast, Guy Ritchie introduces <i>The Wild Bunch</i>, a ragtag group of local hoods known throughout London's underground. In an attempt to make some legit revenue, Mumbles and One Two begin planning real estate ventures. In doing so they wind up in debt to the local crime boss and loanshark, Lenny Cole. Throw in a bored accountant with dangerous tastes, a shady Russian oligarch, dope fiends, gun thugs and one real <em>RockNRolla</em> and you have a recipe for success.</p><br>

                    <p>While failing to achieve the acclaim and success of his debut <i>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</i> and the subsequent <i>Snatch</i>, Guy Ritchie returned to his usual self after releasing a few less than stellar efforts. RockNRolla throws you out of a moving vehicle and into the mix of a group of fast talking London gangsters and before you realize what's going on, you feel like part of the gang.</p><br>

                    <p>While not perfect, it's one of my personal favorite films, I give it 8/10.</p>

                        <h3>Trivia</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Originally written as a trilogy, <i>The Real RockNRolla</i> was the planned sequel. Unfortunately as more time passes, the less likely this will ever come to fruition.</li>
                            <li>Mark Strong who plays <i>Archie</i> prefers to shave his head for his roles due to his receding hairline. He wears a hairpiece in this film.</li>
                            <li>Guy Ritchie makes a cameo, riding his bicycle past Roman and Mickey as they enter Johnny's drug den.</li>
