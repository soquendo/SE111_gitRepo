            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 70);">Born and raised in Rhode Island, I grew up in Pawtucket and Lincoln where my only concerns were baseball, soccer, video games and music. Frequent childhood trips to Queens, NY to visit family would eventually influence the decision to attend audio school in Manhattan, which in turn led to finding work at the Javits Center as part of Teamsters Local 807. Hobbies include photography, videography and graphic design; as well as recording and mixing music. A naturally curious person, I like to think I know a moderate amount across a broad range of different topics. Jack of all trades, master of none.</p>
